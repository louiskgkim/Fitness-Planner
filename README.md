## 1. Description
The purpose of this project was to learn how to collaborate with multiple people
by using GitHub. One member would be the administrator who would set up the repository and
set up the rules in order for members to push changes into the project. To work as a team
while creating an application was a huge key point in this project to show future employers
collaborative skills and coding abilities.
